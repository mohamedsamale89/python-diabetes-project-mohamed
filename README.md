 Analyzing and comparing the effectiveness of four machine learning algorithms in predicting the onset of diabetes using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset.

# Introduction
The prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing, reaching alarming levels due to a combination of factors such as dietary patterns, lifestyle choices, and genetic predisposition. Type 2 diabetes, in particular, has escalated into a significant global contributor to mortality. To address this surge in chronic cases, an effective prognostic tool capable of early-stage diabetes detection is essential. Machine learning has emerged as a promising solution for fulfilling this role. Originating from the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset serves the purpose of diagnosing diabetes by leveraging diagnostic measurements. Comprising a set of independent medical predictors and a dependent target variable, "Outcome," this dataset encompasses diverse factors including BMI, pregnancy count, insulin levels, and age. Through the application of various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and decision trees, we aim to predict the likelihood of diabetes occurrence. This study aims to determine the most proficient machine learning algorithm based on performance scores.


# Software

The group selected to used Google Colaboratory as the Python software to conduct the final project report. Google Colaboratory, commonly referred to as "Colab," is a popular product from Google Research that enables users to write and execute Python code directly through a web browser.

# dataset

The dataset utilized in this study is known as the Pima Indians diabetes dataset. Its primary goal is to predict whether women will develop diabetes based on a range of body measurements. Compiled during the 1980s, this dataset captures information about the Pima Indian community residing in Phoenix, USA. Within the provided dataset, a total of 8 distinct features are present. These encompass factors such as the number of pregnancies, concentration of glucose in the bloodstream, blood pressure levels, skin thickness, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), a diabetes pedigree function, and age. The ultimate target of interest is denoted as the "Outcome," serving as a class variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

# findings

In this study, we tested four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a decision tree. After evaluating their performance on the testing dataset, we found that the logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy at 77.92%. The support vector machine followed with 74.89% accuracy, KNN with 74.68%, and the decision tree with 63.59%. Based on these accuracy scores and overall performance, we concluded that the logistic regression model outperformed the others.This outcome is significant as it differs from conclusions reached in similar studies
